<h4>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h4>
<p>A: HTML is like the basic structure of a website with all the containers to hold it together, CSS is like the decorator for a webpage and makes those containers look good and DOM is simply the structure of the Page and how it interacts with each other in a tree structure e.g. within the head of the document there is a header h1</p>

<h4> What is the box model?</h4>
<p>A:each element on an HTML page is divided into a box regardless of its shape. This is the box model and each box contains a border, padding, margin and content. The content part of the box contains all the information like text and pictures, the padding is a transparent layer outside the content, the border is simply a border going round the content and padding and lastly the margin clears space outside of the border </p>
