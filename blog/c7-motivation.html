        <h4>
          How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?

      <div class = "twelve columns">
        <p>
          A: I think this lens is quite revealing. It explains why many successful people seem driven by more than just money and stimulus because they are on their purpose and those things just come as a byproduct of their efforts. This is not to say they don't desire pleasure, its just that pleasure is not a good enough motivator in and off itself due to its fleeting and often short sighted scope.

      </div>
      <div class="twelve columns">
        <h4>
           From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise, What are your core values?
        </h4>
      </div>
      <div class = "twelve columns">
        <p>
          A: Freedom, honesty, integrity, work ethic, self responsibility, self amusement, going to bed a little smarter each day and positive contribution. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="twelve columns">
        <h4>
           What do you stand for?
        </h4>
      </div>
      <div class = "twelve columns">
        <p>
          A: I stand for individual choice and the fact that to get what you want you must deserve it. Nobody else is responsible for your outcomes except for you. Sure, you are born with advantages and disadvantages but you must deal the hand you are given and it is up to you to make the most of it. I really like the quote from Charlie Munger that states "To get what you want you must deserve what you want, the world is not yet a crazy enough place to reward a bunch of undeserving people". I also believe that one should have fun and keep himself or herself amused. I could go on and on but for the sake of this blog I will leave it at that haha

      <div class="twelve columns">
        <h4>
            How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?
        </h4>
      </div>
      <div class = "twelve columns">
        <p>
          I felt more in touch with my emotions and surroundings when performing these exercises. It is always interesting to feel how different ideas and situations make you respond internally as this is often overlooked in general life.
