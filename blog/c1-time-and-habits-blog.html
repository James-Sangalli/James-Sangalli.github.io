    <p> which timebox and habits techniques did you try </p>
    <p>I tried out pomodoro and I am already experimenting with trying little things each day to build up habits. It reminds me of the quote "I do not fear a man who can do 10,000 kicks I fear the man who does a kick a day for 10,000 days"

    I am also trying out pomodoro

    <p>How important many little good habits built up over time can be extremely helpful to a person's success.</p>
