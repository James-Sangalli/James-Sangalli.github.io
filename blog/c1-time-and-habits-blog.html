    <h1>My Blog: Time and habits</h1>
    <p> Hello and welcome to my blog! </p>
    
    <p> which timebox and habits techniques did you try </p>
    <p>I tried out using things like chocolate and coffee to induce a pleasure response toward my tasks and I have already experimented with trying little things each day to build up habits. It reminds me of the quote "I do not fear a man who can do 10,000 kicks I fear the man who does a kick a day for 10,000 days"

    I am also trying out pomodoro
    </p>

    <p>What did you find interesting?</p>
    <p>How important many little good habits built up over time can be extremely helpful to a person's success.</p>

    <p>what worked for you?</p>
    <p>Small Habit build up and reward stimulus</p>

    <p>Which will you experiment further with? </p>
    <p>Pomodoro technique</p>
