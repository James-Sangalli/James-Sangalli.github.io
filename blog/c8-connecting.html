          I think the ability to come into a situation with others whereby you assume the best first and trust first is extremely valuable. People can usually detect at least on a subconsious level whether you are at ease with them or not and it tends to be a self fulfilling prophecy. I try to do this as often as I can when I meet new people and when I do it seems to have a better result.

          Try empathic listening - how did it go?

      </div>
      <div class = "twelve columns">
        <p>
          I enjoyed this exercise, it is often interesting to quiet down and be observant of what the other person feels and is trying to say.

          While at first Skeptical, I found this exercise to be enjoyable and a reminder that others are in a similar situation to yourself. Often we think our problems are unique and special to ourselves but in reality this is rarely the case.

          This exercise reminds me of a time when my friend and I were in europe and we getting aggravated about where to next stay. In the end it was a rather pointless debate. Both sides of the argument were totally valid and it in the end consensus was reached based on finding a middle ground.
