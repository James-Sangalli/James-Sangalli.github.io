          A responsive site is a webpage which is compatible to be easily viewed on a range of screen sizes and devices. This is very important nowadays as the variety of devices is vast.

          What is mobile first design and why is it important?
        </h4>
      </div>
      <div class = "twelve columns">
        <p>
          Mobile first design is when a website is first designed to be viewed on a mobile device before other screen sizes. This is important because a large portion of the population does the majority of their browsing on a mobile device and thus it is important to have it function properly on a mobile.

          What are frameworks and what are the pros and cons of using one?
        </h4>
      </div>
      <div class = "twelve columns">
        <p>
          Frameworks are basically set CSS structures which you implement and alter in your own site. The benefits of this are obvious, for one you can start much faster and gives you a nice clean structure to build on. A drawback of this however is that your freedom is restricted because you have to use their semantic tags. It also means that you will have extra code that you might not use which has the potential to bloat your code files. We used the skeleton Framework and this happens to be quite basic and neat and so these issues are minimized.

          What is a wireframe and what is the point of it?
        </h4>
      </div>
      <div class = "twelve columns">
        <p>
          A wireframe is essentially a hand or computer drawn basic model of the potential structure of your future webpage. The point of this is to give the designer a brief idea of what to design in their webpage.

      <div class = "twelve columns">
        <p>
          I found it difficult to position my elements such as the toolbar, columns and footer. This was the case because I found the dimensions difficult to keep in place and as a result I spent a lot of time playing around with it.
