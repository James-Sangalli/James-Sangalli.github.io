          There have been many times where I have been stuck on something silly like a mis spelled variable or a missing bracket. Sometimes such a trivial error will take time to uncover but often persistance will pay off and sometimes you will find a cleaner way to do something that requires less code. Just today I spent a long time trying to figure out why my query selector was having issues only to discover that it wasn't needed in the first place. Haha, thanks Mix :). It felt great to have the error fixed so that the game would at least start to work!

          During my struggles with the racing game I first started out using pseudo code to go over what it is that I wanted to program and give a basic idea of how it could work. This was great in giving you a rough idea of the process without having to worry about getting the syntax perfect for the computer. Throughout the process I was constantly trying different ways to have something work like using querySelector and getByElement idea and finding out what each could do. It was also wise to use the console to log out what was happening and where the code broke down. Today I decided to go in to the campus to work on it and after collaborating with other cohort members and speaking with Mix we were able to better articulate our issues and solve them.

          .map() performs a similar function to a for loop. It can take a value and alter it based on what it is programmed to do expect without the need for a for loop. If for example you wanted to do something simple like add 1 to each number parsed from an array you could use .map instead to add it without having to use the for loop. 
          .filter() typically returns a boolean value on an array rather than returning the array itself, it is like a checker to see if the array element equals what was specified in the parenthesis.
          .reduce() takes two parameters and uses them to iterate through an array returning only one (the final result). It basically iterates through an array based on a starting point (first parameter) and assigns the result to the other variable. An example of this could be totaling up the scores of the pupils in a class room whereby the starting point would be the first student and the other variable being the total result of all the students.
