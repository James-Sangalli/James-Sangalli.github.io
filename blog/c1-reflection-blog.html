    <p> Hello and welcome to my blog! </p>
    <p> Q&A <p>

    <p>What's your take on the DBC / EDA experience?

    A: I think this program is awesome, it allows for inter-dependance of thought and progress instead of the rigid traditional methods of spoon feeding arbitiary knowledge </p>

    <p> What are your impressions?

    A: My impressions of this course is that it is going to be challenging but also rewarding and interesting
    </p>

    <p> How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?

    A: I hope to be able to provide value to the course and the other members with not just coding abilities but also that of the soft intangible skills which are very important. </p>

    <p> Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?

    No. I expect this to be very challenging but rewarding. </p>

    <p> Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?

    I am excited to participate in this learning environment and not just for the reasons of code, I am excited to better my ability to learn how to learn as well as improving my soft intangable skills and having better tools to continue learning as learning is a life long endeavour. I am also a bit nervous for sure as I know this will be a challenge. </p>
