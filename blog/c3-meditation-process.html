          Meditation Process

          How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?
        </h4>

      <div class = "twelve columns">
        <p>
        The process over product concept helped me prioritize and time my efforts and prevent having my attention split and focused on too many things at once. It was a great method to keep focus on what's important and focus more on getting something to work rather than striving to have every little detail perfect. 
        </p>

        <h4>
          What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?
        </h4>
      </div>
      <div class = "twelve columns">
        <p>
          I have had a respect for meditation long before reading the chapter, this was a refreshing outlook on it however and a reminder to keep it up as I have a times been slack with it. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="twelve columns">
        <h4>
          What new things have you learnt about meditation?
        </h4>
      </div>
      <div class = "twelve columns">
        <p>
          As stated above I already had a good foundation in the benefits of meditation however this video was a great brush up and reminder of good methods of meditation plus the science behind it.   
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="twelve columns">
        <h4>
          Did any of the suggested mediation techniques stand out to you?
        </h4>
      </div>
      <div class = "twelve columns">
        <p>
          I particularily liked the emphasis on the fact that the sitting position to meditate is subjective and can be adapted to your prefered style so long as you can remain relaxed and focused at the same time.  
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="twelve columns">
        <h4>
          Any other musings?
        </h4>
      </div>
      <div class = "twelve columns">
        <p>
          This video provided excellent motivation for me to remain meditating each night and to keep it up. 
        </p>
