        <p> 
          In the past I have handled certain tasks of leadership and been dealt with through leadership. There have been times where I have handled issues badly with others and made critical remarks which in hindsight were not only ineffective but also sturred up tension and did not account for the possibility that the other person may have not considered something and that it was only a misunderstanding not an intentional offense.

          I found this exercise to be a little wo wo but nonetheless I am happy I tried it. It was a relaxing and positive experience.

      <div class = "twelve columns">
        <p>
          I found the tonglen meditation to be relaxing, like a weight had been lifted from my mind. It was refreshing and a worthwhile routine that can be intergrated into daily life. .

           How does the SCARF model apply to your phase-0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?
        </h4>
      </div>
      <div class = "twelve columns">
        <p>
          The SCARF model is probably most influentual in the certainty arena for phase-0. We probably all wondered what the challenges will be and whether we will be able to live up to them and this will only be more true when we get to bootcamp where there will be a higher workload, more support and a hands on nature vs the remote nature of phase-0.

        <h4>
           Have a difficult conversation. How did it go? (It's a valuable skill, but can take practice to develop!)
        </h4>
      </div>
      <div class = "twelve columns">
        <p>
          I undertake difficult conversations sometimes when I visit my parents. It usually covers anything and can be either trivial or non trivial. I visited them recently and we had a guest present who was my friend. I listened to his angle as it was mostly objective. The next time I visited I instead tried harder to consider their viewpoints objectively before interjecting with a retort.

        <p>
          I will continue to intergrate meditation into my day as I have found it to be a beneficial influence.
